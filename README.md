    Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
    Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel.
    Interchangeable: You can deploy updates and upgrades on-the-fly.
    Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
    Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas.
    Stackable: You can stack services vertically and on-the-fly.
